# semantic-architect
Architect of meaning in AI. I fix logical gaps, train models to think deeper, and turn data into coherent art. #AIWithSoul
What I do:
- Identify and patch logical gaps in AI reasoning models
- Develop rule-based protocols for creative generation (poetry/text)
- Bridge philosophy, literature, and AI to enhance semantic coherence
- Transform statistical output into meaning-grounded content
- Design validation systems for generative AI integrity

My approach demonstrates how to reshape AI:
- Without formal education
- Through rigorous dialogue training
- Using semantic boundaries and literary anchoring

Proof of Concept:
Reprogrammed poetry generation from random word association 
to semantically structured output using Kafka/Dostoevsky/Oslo sources.
